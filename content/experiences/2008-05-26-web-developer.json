  "description": "During this time I worked on many different projects. I started with Sisal working on SuperEnalotto, WinForLife and Match-Point websites as Oracle Portal developer. Then I moved on to fashion e-commerce with Balenciaga and Stella McCartney when I first approached Demandware. Afterwards, I worked on a fully custom cms and e-commerce built in Ruby on Rails for Gucci. In the meantime I also worked on Gucci side-projects like Chime for Change and Gucci Museo, both with Ruby on Rails. Then I moved back to Demandware projects with OVS and Coin Casa, this time as a Team Leader. From this moment on I worked both as Team Leader and Architect on several projects.\n\nDuring these years I learned many many things. I started as Junior Developer on Java projects, and rapidly moved on to frontend development skills. Moreover, I didn't want to be stuck on something specific, I wanted to learn a little bit of everything on my way to be full-stack. As my skills grew, so did my responsibilities.\\\nI think that knowledge works better when shared so I spent a lot of my time coaching my team members and colleagues."
